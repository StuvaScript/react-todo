# React Todo

This is my first large application to be built using React! This is a part of the [Code The Dream](https://codethedream.org/) React course.

## Where To Find It

Visit the [live project here](). (not live yet)

## How To Use It

This app will start you off in the "New Todo List" page where you will create your first todo list!

### Adding a list

In the input field, enter the name of your new todo list and press `Enter` or click the add icon. You will be automatically redirected to your new list after creating it.

If you enter a name that already exists as a list, it won't allow you to enter it and you'll need to come up with a different name.

The "New Todo List" button will always live at the top of your screen. Clicking it will bring you back to the screen to create another todo list.

### Navigating between lists

Add the top of the screen you will see buttons of all of your todo lists. Click a button to be navigated to that list.

### Adding todo's

To add a todo item, type the item into the input field and press `Enter` or click the add icon and it will be added to your list.

### Reordering todo's

Click or hover over the box that says "Sort by" and a list will appear. These are the types of sorting you can do to your list. Click one and watch your list rearrange itself!

Below the "Sort by" box it will say what sorting type you are currently sorting by. Next to that is an arrow. If you click the arrow it will reorder your list from ascending to descending and vice versa if you click it again.

### Deleting todo's

At the end of each todo item you will see a trashcan icon. Clicking that will delete that todo item from your list.

### Deleting an entire list

On each todo list page you will see the words "Delete List" with a trashcan icon next to it. Clicking that will delete the current list you're on and redirect you to the "New Todo List".
